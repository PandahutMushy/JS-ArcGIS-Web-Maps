# JS ArcGIS Web Maps


## About the Project
JS ArcGIS Web Maps is a single page Web Map application that displays NASA PMM Precipitation data in 2D and 3D. Data is loaded using RESTful endpoints and the ArcGIS JavaScript API. Satellite imagery is loaded dynamically and dislpayed via an ArcGIS feature layer that adjusts to time, location and zoom level. Current version by default displays spatial data from July 11 2019. App still under construction.

### Problem Statement

An simple, minimalistic web application built to visualize weather data in 2D and 3D.

### Expected Usage

Minimum viable product:
- Select a location, zoom level and time to visualize weather data
- Select between different types of basemap styles
- Display spatial data from NASA PMM as a feature layer on the map
- Toggle between 2D and 3D viewing

- Stretch:
  - Select from various weather data types, such as mean, minimum and maxumim temperature, dewpoint and vapour pressure deficit
  - Display real-time satellite data
  - Select different dates from which to view data


## Getting Started

## Known Issues 

- Cannot select a different date
- Under construction, might have a few quirks

## To be implemented 

  - Select from various weather data types, such as mean, minimum and maxumim temperature, dewpoint and vapour pressure deficit
